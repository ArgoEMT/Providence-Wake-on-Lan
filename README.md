# Providence Wake on lan

This is a simple app that allows you to wake up your computer from sleep mode using the Wake on LAN protocol.

The app is build to support macOS, Windows, Linux, iOS and Android, but only the macOS and iOS versions have been tested.

It supports English and French (I don't plan to add more languages, but feel free to add them if you want to).

Theme is link to the system theme, so it will change automatically when you change the system theme.
